# Terma Phase 4 Planning

## Overview

This document outlines the planned work for Phase 4 of the Terma terminal component. With the successful completion of Phase 3, which focused on Hermes and Hephaestus integration, Phase 4 will concentrate on quality assurance, performance optimization, and finalization for production use.

## Goals

1. **Quality Assurance**: Ensure robustness and reliability through comprehensive testing
2. **Performance Optimization**: Enhance responsiveness and resource efficiency
3. **Final Integration**: Complete remaining integration points with Tekton components
4. **Documentation**: Finalize all documentation for end users and developers

## Work Packages

### 1. Testing and QA

#### Unit Testing
- Implement unit tests for core modules (terminal.py, session_manager.py, llm_adapter.py)
- Create test fixtures for common terminal operations
- Implement mock WebSocket connections for testing
- Achieve >80% code coverage for core modules

#### Integration Testing
- Test WebSocket session management across browsers
- Verify terminal session isolation and security
- Test detach/reattach functionality with multiple sessions
- Verify LLM integration with different providers

#### Cross-platform Testing
- Test on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Verify functionality across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
- Test on mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)
- Verify functionality under various network conditions

#### Security Review
- Conduct input validation testing
- Test for cross-site scripting vulnerabilities
- Verify proper session isolation
- Review authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Validate handling of untrusted terminal output

### 2. Performance Optimization

#### Frontend Performance
- Optimize terminal rendering performance
- Reduce JavaScript CPU utilization
- Optimize memory usage for long-running sessions
- Implement efficient buffer management for large outputs
- Reduce initial load time

#### Backend Performance
- Optimize WebSocket message processing
- Implement session cleanup for idle connections
- Optimize process resource utilization
- Improve LLM request handling efficiency
- Implement response caching where appropriate

#### Monitoring and Metrics
- Add performance monitoring hooks
- Implement telemetry for terminal operations
- Create metrics for LLM usage and performance
- Add error tracking and reporting

### 3. Final Integration

#### Hephaestus UI Integration
- Finalize component registration with Hephaestus
- Ensure theme compatibility across all UI elements
- Verify responsive design on all screen sizes
- Implement proper keyboard handling within UI context

#### Tekton Launch Scripts
- Update Tekton launch scripts to include Terma
- Implement proper startup sequence
- Add configuration validation
- Ensure proper initialization order with other components

#### Rhetor Integration (if available)
- Implement proper connection to Rhetor for LLM operations
- Leverage Rhetor's capabilities for specialized prompt handling
- Migrate direct LLM calls to Rhetor's prompt engine
- Maintain backward compatibility for environments without Rhetor

#### Hermes Message Bus Finalization
- Complete event publishing for all terminal states
- Finalize subscription handling for external commands
- Implement proper error handling for message bus failures
- Document all message types and payloads

### 4. Documentation Finalization

#### User Documentation
- Create comprehensive user guide
- Add FAQ section for common operations
- Include troubleshooting guide
- Create quickstart tutorial

#### Developer Documentation
- Finalize API reference
- Document WebSocket protocol
- Create integration guide for other components
- Include architecture diagrams and data flow documentation

#### Operations Documentation
- Document deployment process
- Create configuration reference
- Include monitoring and maintenance guidance
- Add performance tuning recommendations

## Timeline

| Phase | Tasks | Duration | Dependencies |

## Completion Criteria

Phase 4 will be considered complete when:

1. All unit and integration tests pass consistently
2. Performance metrics meet or exceed targets
   - Terminal response time < 50ms
   - WebSocket message processing < 10ms
   - Memory usage < 100MB per session
3. All documented security issues are resolved
4. Documentation is complete and verified
5. Successful integration with all Tekton components
6. Final review and approval by project stakeholders
